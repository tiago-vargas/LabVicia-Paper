  abstractNote = { &lt;p&gt; We introduce a novel model-agnostic system that explains the behavior of complex models with high-precision rules called anchors,
  representing local,
  &quot;sufficient&quot; conditions for predictions. We propose an algorithm to efficiently compute these explanations for any black-box model with high-probability guarantees. We demonstrate the flexibility of anchors by explaining a myriad of different models for different domains and tasks. In a user study,
  we show that anchors enable users to predict how a model would behave on unseen instances with less effort and higher precision,
  as compared to existing linear explanations or no explanations. &lt;/p&gt; },
