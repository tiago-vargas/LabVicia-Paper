\section{Preliminaries}

\section{Improving Minimal Explanations}

% TODO: Talk about how to improve an explanation given an minimal explanation

% TODO: Talk about sufficient and necessary explanations

Suppose we have a neural network classifier with inputs $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$, $x_5$, and possible outputs $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$. Suppose, after passing $x_1 = 0.89$, $x_2 = -1.07$, $x_3 = 0.42$, $x_4 = -0.61$, $x_5 = -0.67$ to the classifier, we get a minimal explanation as follows:

\[
\{x_1 = 0.89, x_3 = 0.42, x_4 = -0.61\}
\]

We are now interested in discovering which range of values for the variables $x_1$, $x_3$ and $x_4$ that still guarantees the output to be $C_2$. The idea is to see if the problem is solvable when walking at steps of $\epsilon$ at the vicinity of the point. To achieve this, we treat each constraint of type $x = c$ as $c \le x \le c$, and check if the problem is solvable, after each increment of size $\epsilon$, one side at time. We expect the improved explanation to be a set of constraints that describe the range of each variable in the minimal explanation, such as $c - k_1 \cdot \epsilon \le x \le c + k_2 \cdot \epsilon$, where $k$ is the number of steps taken. In this case, we would do

\[
\{x_1 \ge 0.89, x_1 \le 0.89, x_3 \ge 0.42, x_3 \le 0.42, x_4 \ge -0.61, x_4 \le -0.61\}
\]

Then, for each of these constraints, we try to solve\dots
