\begin{abstract}
  This meta-paper describes the style to be used in articles and short papers
  for SBC conferences. In both cases, abstracts should not have more than
  10 lines and must be in the first page of the paper.
\end{abstract}

% \begin{resumo}
%   Este meta-artigo descreve o estilo a ser usado na confecção de artigos e
%   resumos de artigos para publicação nos anais das conferências organizadas
%   pela SBC. É solicitada a escrita de resumo e abstract apenas para os artigos
%   escritos em português. Artigos em inglês deverão apresentar apenas abstract.
%   Nos dois casos, o autor deve tomar cuidado para que o resumo (e o abstract)
%   não ultrapassem 10 linhas cada, sendo que ambos devem estar na primeira
%   página do artigo.

\section{Introduction}
% \section{General Information}

% All full papers and posters (short papers) submitted to some SBC conference,
% including any supporting documents, should be written in English or in
% Portuguese. The format paper should be A4 with single column, 3.5 cm for upper
% margin, 2.5 cm for bottom margin and 3.0 cm for lateral margins, without
% headers or footers. The main font must be Times, 12 point nominal size, with 6
% points of space before each paragraph. Page numbers must be suppressed.

% Full papers must respect the page limits defined by the conference.
% Conferences that publish just abstracts ask for \textbf{one}-page texts.


\section{Preliminaries}
% \section{First Page} \label{sec:firstpage}

% The first page must display the paper title, the name and address of the
% authors, the abstract in English and ``resumo'' in Portuguese (``resumos'' are
% required only for papers written in Portuguese). The title must be centered
% over the whole page, in 16 point boldface font and with 12 points of space
% before itself. Author names must be centered in 12 point font, bold, all of
% them disposed in the same line, separated by commas and with 12 points of
% space after the title. Addresses must be centered in 12 point font, also with
% 12 points of space after the authors' names. E-mail addresses should be
% written using font Courier New, 10 point nominal size, with 6 points of space
% before and 6 points of space after.

% The abstract and ``resumo'' (if is the case) must be in 12 point Times font,
% indented 0.8cm on both sides. The word \textbf{Abstract} and \textbf{Resumo},
% should be written in boldface and must precede the text.


% \section{CD-ROMs and Printed Proceedings}

% In some conferences, the papers are published on CD-ROM while only the
% abstract is published in the printed Proceedings. In this case, authors are
% invited to prepare two final versions of the paper. One, complete, to be
% published on the CD and the other, containing only the first page, with
% abstract and ``resumo'' (for papers in Portuguese).

\section{Improving Minimal Explanations}
% talk about how to improve an explanation given an minimal explanation

% talk about sufficient and necessary explanations

Suppose we have a neural network classifier with inputs $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$, $x_5$, and possible outputs $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$. Suppose, after passing $x_1 = 0.89$, $x_2 = -1.07$, $x_3 = 0.42$, $x_4 = -0.61$, $x_5 = -0.67$ to the classifier, we get a minimal explanation as follows:

\[
\{x_1 = 0.89, x_3 = 0.42, x_4 = -0.61\}
\]

We are now interested in discovering which range of values for the variables $x_1$, $x_3$ and $x_4$ that still guarantees the output to be $C_2$. The idea is to see if the problem is solvable when walking at steps of $\epsilon$ at the vicinity of the point. To achieve this, we treat each constraint of type $x = c$ as $c \le x \le c$, and check if the problem is solvable, after each increment of size $\epsilon$, one side at time. We expect the improved explanation to be a set of constraints that describe the range of each variable in the minimal explanation, such as $c - k_1 \cdot \epsilon \le x \le c + k_2 \cdot \epsilon$, where $k$ is the number of steps taken. In this case, we would do

\[
\{x_1 \ge 0.89, x_1 \le 0.89, x_3 \ge 0.42, x_3 \le 0.42, x_4 \ge -0.61, x_4 \le -0.61\}
\]

Then, for each of these constraints, we try to solve



% \section{Sections and Paragraphs}

% Section titles must be in boldface, 13pt, flush left. There should be an extra
% 12 pt of space before each title. Section numbering is optional. The first
% paragraph of each section should not be indented, while the first lines of
% subsequent paragraphs should be indented by 1.27 cm.

% \section{Figures and Captions}\label{sec:figs}


% Figure and table captions should be centered if less than one line
% (Figure~\ref{fig:exampleFig1}), otherwise justified and indented by 0.8cm on
% both margins, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exampleFig2}. The caption font must
% be Helvetica, 10 point, boldface, with 6 points of space before and after each
% caption.

% \begin{figure}[ht]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{fig1.jpg}
% \caption{A typical figure}
% \label{fig:exampleFig1}
% \end{figure}

% \begin{figure}[ht]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{fig2.jpg}
% \caption{This figure is an example of a figure caption taking more than one
%   line and justified considering margins mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:figs}.}
% \label{fig:exampleFig2}
% \end{figure}

% In tables, try to avoid the use of colored or shaded backgrounds, and avoid
% thick, doubled, or unnecessary framing lines. When reporting empirical data,
% do not use more decimal digits than warranted by their precision and
% reproducibility. Table caption must be placed before the table (see Table 1)
% and the font used must also be Helvetica, 10 point, boldface, with 6 points of
% space before and after each caption.

% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \caption{Variables to be considered on the evaluation of interaction
%   techniques}
% \label{tab:exTable1}
% \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{table.jpg}
% \end{table}

% \section{Images}

% All images and illustrations should be in black-and-white, or gray tones,
% excepting for the papers that will be electronically available (on CD-ROMs,
% internet, etc.). The image resolution on paper should be about 600 dpi for
% black-and-white images, and 150-300 dpi for grayscale images.  Do not include
% images with excessive resolution, as they may take hours to print, without any
% visible difference in the result.

% \section{References}

% Bibliographic references must be unambiguous and uniform.  We recommend giving
% the author names references in brackets, e.g. \cite{knuth:84},
% \cite{boulic:91}, and \cite{smith:99}.

% The references must be listed using 12 point font size, with 6 points of space
% before each reference. The first line of each reference should not be
% indented, while the subsequent should be indented by 0.5 cm.

\section{Experiments}
% talk about that dataset {A \ge 0.5 \implies 1} and mentin how `anchor` fails to find the boundary (0.5)

% - execution time
% - correctness
